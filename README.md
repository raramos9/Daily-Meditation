# How it's made

Tech Used: HTML, CSS

By using flexbox, elements and divs were able to be easily aligned, and styled in order to contruct a smooth layout. 

# Lessons Learned: 

The major takeaways with this project was learning how to effectively manipulate flexbox in order to create a desireable alignment, learning and understanding different aspects of the box model, and finally, exploring different ways to use styling.

Overall, this project taught me what's possible in HTML and CSS, and I hope to explore this area further to make more cool websites!
